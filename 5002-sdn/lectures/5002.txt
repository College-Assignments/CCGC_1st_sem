 This is physical there so what it does it just Boots the information repeat this information The Hub is about the dumbest device they will broadcast information be there we are dealing with devices one state of beaches to the machine yeah but Ford is connected with broadcast information to everyone okay the repeater you can think of a repeater the data gets made it once it reaches the other end so you after specific size in a network you need to put a repeater so that data doesn't get paid if you can boost it up as the breakfast of repeated and this these are just layer one device that they don't have rain they will just broadcast information or repeat they do not know where exactly to send they're looking into the routing table they're not smart that's clear one layer 2 some books call it bridge and usually in the research paper they use the term switch they don't use apps repeater breeds or router they just say they are one switch later to switch airport switch in the research page but some textbook say switch specifically means in there deal with the Mac addresses so they have smarter brain than the layer one layer one just alien actually read the back address and decide which Port this Mac address is connected okay so if they working necklace what they doesn't care the smartest bear calls router for their PC switch they deal with IP address they can deal with all addresses so this is it's probably clear which bendy and lyric or so this is happening in this is happening let's work on internet all right there so that's the basic difference that layer one is the dumbest they just broadcast a followers they have to condemned with messages they are seriously the idea so these routers and usually layer 3 or therefore they can deal with a lot a very limited remembers like HP has its own they are three or four switch on Device just go have the phone and it depends on the hardware design which one is faster income how many protocol actually they understand okay now the purpose of this when we go to sdn we'll see it's a software that will behave rather than window specific device that you are confined with only whatever service they provide whoever buildings Cisco or HP or universe and you can get the control brain in a virtual machine with software and they can start behaving white like all these different layer devices that's why we are learning the the basics first so that you can see the difference once we go to soccer any question on these layer devices so this is dealing with the big screen this is Mac address this is like the other support Okay so is it typical to hold it if you were then running a small business how many layer devices do you purchase let's say you're running some service and these are check the machines also connected so it's a very small business okay and is this play a tree device does it needs to deal with it has to be up to your layer 4 because it needs to deal with ideas before that before connected to internet for the data traffic coming out of Internet into the network get us to go through the be on there for device which is called louder and once you are in the internet then they could be just to layer to well that deals with Mac address you have an area where you may not need like in this room if you're setting the machine of a few more Dexter machines and connecting them maybe a cup is good enough broadcast that's to see the purpose of these layer devices now obviously the higher the layer devices the expensivities so here there will be a lot of in between hops before it reaches destination when you're sending data Internet or when the data is coming and it did now you decide how many layer I want to layer to you're going to purchase for your own network that has to be a DNS server running there has to be a DStv server running purpose of thcp is again assigning unique IP address to your employees so whatever I even keep purchase it has to be that's why you run in DC now usually that you you run it back up here you see me server too because if the primary one goes down translate to the Apple Internet if it's ever goes down say I'm putting down I'm going down so there is a heartbeat at the cluster of service and all the cloud computing does Legend to check whether any server is going down keep sending at the back and heartbeat messages to their own service so if they don't receive response then that's the only way they can tell this something had happened this went down if the primary DHCP server goes down it's a mess for your company so in Practical situation if you purchase let's say 100 ID I find HIV into the primary DHCP server and the 20% as a backup so when the primary DHCP goes down only the president vice president or the managers can still have access to him so the secondary DNS dxcp will route the it to them imagine if a cloud service going down and loss of gymnastics a map is back up here honey whether it's any any club because Jacob infrastructure Lord of supplies going on so they are running back up the ACP service the depends on your design what layer Netflix now talking about what's up IP address we said okay see you're connected to the internet you need a unique ID Boulevard IP address is expensive I mean you can't purchase you can purchase if you're running a business like come back if you have so many students at 15,000 students or 20,000 students that's a few hundred employees and each of them using laptop on their phone their tablet so these days one person carry multiple device right so you need that when you need ideas and it's not possible to purchase that thing so the company is purchased minimum might be it let's sound if you maybe 10 to 15 and they use the DNS to advertise those IP address looking into that the outside world knows okay this is how about ID but then how you manage building students having UniQue Ideas so that is a concept called public IP and privately Public Ivy and Friday there is a range in those blocks of it version 4 are version 6 say these are actually reserved for Spider-Man so let's take an example of you can explain this let's say the idea this is limited we are not doing version 4 version 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 content these are the only can I be Humber purchased it for the same 15,000 students how they can handle them take another game please can I pay to 15,000 that's where the other purpose of good address comes into place they said that two-fold the purpose of food at this one is to define the application is the other is to associate with GID address to maintain the uniqueness and benefits this private IP publicizing concept public IP is the one purchase located this belongs to Amber business please belongs to Seneca this belongs to our University of Toronto this belongs to whatever then or a company XYZ so humble purchase only these 10 and setting up artist other 10 that's 11 to 20 how did manage unique ideas that is a range something 65,000 okay and I don't think there is any company running business this month at this wedding employees at the same time Microsoft enough of getting the end of the West Amazon's the the drivers who are delivering their not using Amazon so $65,000 Google I'm in the Microsoft even they don't have this many employees baby that's that better be a real piece you associate report address with the actually purchased so these are the first 10 might be referred to as publicizing and they will associate let's say any number 12,500 so this number will tell once you reach The Humper Network which machine or which student machine you're looking so they will associate this with a port number and that will be mapped to a private item so maybe if you need so many idea address you do not purchase that money you're going to purchase only one or two ID because it's expensive and that part just one is called private and there are there is a range to deserve every company to using internally that is called the private and the mapping is done by Gateway or not voice call Network address translator they do all these stuff conversion of 54 / 6 conversion of Mac address to an itv6 address conversion of public IP to private if you are getting winning the same network within humbug the private is good enough what about internally have the company is using has he wanted to send it to outside your network then this conversion will have to happen Okay and then once you received information outside your network again this conversion has to happen to convert from this public to privatize period is this scenario makes sense run a business or other let's say about service provider you purchase from ICA and then the everyday scale your user is using so if you it's not only b2c that is business decline all these clouds are just provided are B2B and give me prospector a platform to other businesses and those businesses have their own clients and you may be inclined you're running your business you have the user using the your service and your service is hosted in a cloud I'll call let's say of the West So based on your user the instances will be elevated so if you think there will be multiple server applications and in off peak hours there will be less instance required right so it needs to be trained and it needs to be expanded so this public and private IP conversion is happening all the time frequent your conversion is happening based on that Enterprise came up with the concept elastic IP elastic ID they see how often your conversion is happening then they keep the same ID they do not change it okay they keep it but if your servers are shut down for a long time getting started then they will take off the ID okay so if you want the static IP or you're running a business you wonder you have to pay more then otherwise at home whoever your internet provider Will Roger or CIA or hack connected providers of I sleep providers available they give you Dynamic ID I miss their ID change after every 3 days the lease may not be renewed with the same ID so your IP will keep changing and the conversion is built up with practice stuff here and I guess we'll continue in the lab class will do subnet mask and very important concept when you're talking about there okay I'll see you soon I don't want to take profit than you at this time you try to form a group of five for your Capstone project or project management class you're going to do a write a proposal if you have your own industry link that's good if not then we'll try to hook you up with some industry partner so we want you to solve industry and the problems one group is meeting on Tuesday so we want you to form the group from the same whichever section you're enrolled okay till week 7 you're probably showing up on Tuesday evening right now from the same section yesterday or medicine not every day after reset okay thank you I'll see you next time OK Google
